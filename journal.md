Light.
Compass.
Movement.
Within my experiences of using Bolt, I think the most interesting feature was Bolt's light sensor. Luminosity, or "Lux"
measures light from Bolt's surroundings to use however the code says to. It can be used for movement which I thought was
cool. You can use it like a game of Tug and War via flashlights.

Weekly Journal Prompt: It is important to be precise when coding because even the smallest mistake can led to distaster
and failure in a program. If steps or details are missed in coding, the code will not work. It is important to develop
good habits of listening and attention to detail to not mess up in the future.

Without technology, life would be harder.

Video game programmers intrests me because of what they do. Their tasks include developing gameplay systems, optimizing
performance, implementing AI and physics, and bug fixing. They tipically need a bacholors or masters degree in a related
field, and be used with C++, C#, Python, Unity, or Unreal Engine. The career of game programmers is expected to be 47%
more(2020-2030). This reflects me because I wanted to do this for a long time.
