Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Light.
Compass.
Movement.
Within my experiences of using Bolt, I think the most interesting feature was Bolt's light sensor. Luminosity, or "Lux"
measures light from Bolt's surroundings to use however the code says to. It can be used for movement which I thought was
cool. You can use it like a game of Tug and War via flashlights.

Weekly Journal Prompt: It is important to be precise when coding because even the smallest mistake can led to distaster
and failure in a program. If steps or details are missed in coding, the code will not work. It is important to develop
good habits of listening and attention to detail to not mess up in the future.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Technology plays a role everywhere, everyday. It would be hard for bus drivers if they had to
memberize which routes and streets to take without a GPS. Every time you use your phone, your using computer science.
Without technology, life would be harder.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Video game programmers intrests me because of what they do. Their tasks include developing gameplay
systems, optimizing performance, implementing AI and physics, and bug fixing. They tipically need a bacholors or masters
degree in a related field, and be used with C++, C#, Python, Unity, or Unreal Engine. The career of game programmers is
expected to be 47% more(2020-2030). This reflects me because I wanted to do this for a long time.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Learning how to code can inprove the ability to solve problems because in coding, when problems
arise, you must fix them or the code will not work. Learning how to code can be useful in developing apps and software in
other industries. In a grand project, collaboration is key. But when by yourself, let your creativity run wild.

Weekly Journal Prompt:
AI can inprove and help our lives be better. Most factories have robots working 24/7 and can make more products than humans
ever could. In places like hospitails and schools, AI can make scheaduels to make life more convient.

However, AI also has downsides. It is taking over jobs like factories, receptionists, customer service, e commerce, and many
more jobs. Also because of how difficult it is to program AI, if you can figure out the algorithm, you can do whatever you
want, or promote whatever. It also act as security, so if hackers figure it out, you might be in trouble.
