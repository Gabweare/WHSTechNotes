Light.
Compass.
Movement.
Within my experiences of using Bolt, I think the most interesting feature was Bolt's light sensor. Luminosity, or "Lux"
measures light from Bolt's surroundings to use however the code says to. It can be used for movement which I thought was
cool. You can use it like a game of Tug and War via flashlights.

good habits of listening and attention to detail to not mess up in the future.

memberize which routes and streets to take without a GPS. Every time you use your phone, your using computer science.
Without technology, life would be harder.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Video game programmers intrests me because of what they do. Their tasks include developing gameplay
systems, optimizing performance, implementing AI and physics, and bug fixing. They tipically need a bacholors or masters
degree in a related field, and be used with C++, C#, Python, Unity, or Unreal Engine. The career of game programmers is
expected to be 47% more(2020-2030). This reflects me because I wanted to do this for a long time.
# October 15, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: Learning how to code can inprove the ability to solve problems because in coding, when problems
arise, you must fix them or the code will not work. Learning how to code can be useful in developing apps and software in
other industries. In a grand project, collaboration is key. But when by yourself, let your creativity run wild.

Weekly Journal Prompt:
AI can inprove and help our lives be better. Most factories have robots working 24/7 and can make more products than humans
ever could. In places like hospitails and schools, AI can make scheaduels to make life more convient.

However, AI also has downsides. It is taking over jobs like factories, receptionists, customer service, e commerce, and many
more jobs. Also because of how difficult it is to program AI, if you can figure out the algorithm, you can do whatever you
want, or promote whatever. It also act as security, so if hackers figure it out, you might be in trouble.

Weekly Journal Prompt: By making it more easier to count how many votes for one person or party. Because of ads, polititions
can increase how many people see and know about them. However, polititions could also hire hackers to increase their votes
or decrease another politition's votes.
# November 6, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: It is important to protect your personal information when online because hackers can and will use it
for personal gain. By not being dumb and careful of what you say, your information can be secured. I don't share personal
things online except in messages in group chats. Don't share your personal information with them.
# November 12, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: Christmas is a holiday where we learn the gift of giving, family time, and gifts. We can relate to
christmas with technology because of online shopping. Data analysis can analyze what gifts are popular and give advice on
what gifts they might like.

As technology advances, it might use more data from your history to find out the perfect gift for you. And not just for
holidays, but for other events too. You can have all the news you would want at the tip of your fingers.
# November 18, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: Technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food because the AI and robots are
in charge of maintaining our food. Because of vertical farming, more food is available faster for the holidays. If there was
a outage of power, our fridges would stop working, and the food would rot.
# December 2, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: AI that can learn from humans will be a huge leap towards the future.
Follow up Questions: I worry that AI will continue to take over jobs. AI could help me with my code. We should be careful as
not to give AI too much control. However, Avancing AI is much necessary to continue towards the future.
# December 9, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: Brainrot in my words mean anonying words with little to no meaning. I feel that digital media has had
a negative impact on my mental being. I'm seeing low quality "slop", and amazing storytelling "lore". If possible, block all

# January 13, 2025
Weekly Journal Prompt: Due to AI, thousands of jobs are in danger. I believe that AI, as good as it is for everyone else, is a
burden for workers because of all the jobs it takes from them. I plan to switch to Cyber Security classes since AI can't protect
digital information and make firewalls.
# January 22, 2025
Weekly Journal Prompt: Government intervention impacts company technology companies and their users because if the company is not
American, it will probably get accused of something. As America doesn't have good relationships with chinese property. Try to
show proof that they don't steal data.

I would add a perrmission to follow button so strangers can't just follow you. Of course you can turn it off in the settings.
I could use some of tiktok's feactures in app development.

# February 24, 2025
Weekly Journal Prompt: More older people can use sites like Google and Bing to find out the meaning of these words. A benefit
for adding slang words everywhere is that it would be easier for young people to understand. On the other hand, for the older
people, sentences would be more confusing.

communacation. My cell phone helped me talk with my grandma to pick my birthday gift.

the break, which counts as app functionality.

Weekly Journal Prompt: I think by adding AI to NCAA's March Madness, it has oppertunities to increase excitment. Although it
could predict who wins, it isn't always right. So fans can still choose their favorite players without worrying too much.

Weekly Journal Prompt:
I believe that the 100 men could beat the gorilla. Not only are gorillas mostly peaceful, but humans have stratigy and we outnumber
it. Obvisly we would lose a few men, but we would still win.

Since a lot of people matured from COVID, we understand that this is just a trend and we should NOT fight a gorilla. This trend
evolved from a single question to countless people making tik-toks with the gorilla (or humans) doing crazy things. This trend
provides both entertainment and education.
