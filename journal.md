Light.
Compass.
Movement.
Within my experiences of using Bolt, I think the most interesting feature was Bolt's light sensor. Luminosity, or "Lux"
measures light from Bolt's surroundings to use however the code says to. It can be used for movement which I thought was
cool. You can use it like a game of Tug and War via flashlights.

Weekly Journal Prompt: It is important to be precise when coding because even the smallest mistake can led to distaster
and failure in a program. If steps or details are missed in coding, the code will not work. It is important to develop
good habits of listening and attention to detail to not mess up in the future.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Technology plays a role everywhere, everyday. It would be hard for bus drivers if they had to
memberize which routes and streets to take without a GPS. Every time you use your phone, your using computer science.
Without technology, life would be harder.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Video game programmers intrests me because of what they do. Their tasks include developing gameplay
systems, optimizing performance, implementing AI and physics, and bug fixing. They tipically need a bacholors or masters
degree in a related field, and be used with C++, C#, Python, Unity, or Unreal Engine. The career of game programmers is
expected to be 47% more(2020-2030). This reflects me because I wanted to do this for a long time.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Learning how to code can inprove the ability to solve problems because in coding, when problems
arise, you must fix them or the code will not work. Learning how to code can be useful in developing apps and software in
other industries. In a grand project, collaboration is key. But when by yourself, let your creativity run wild.

Weekly Journal Prompt:
AI can inprove and help our lives be better. Most factories have robots working 24/7 and can make more products than humans
ever could. In places like hospitails and schools, AI can make scheaduels to make life more convient.

However, AI also has downsides. It is taking over jobs like factories, receptionists, customer service, e commerce, and many
more jobs. Also because of how difficult it is to program AI, if you can figure out the algorithm, you can do whatever you
want, or promote whatever. It also act as security, so if hackers figure it out, you might be in trouble.

Weekly Journal Prompt: By making it more easier to count how many votes for one person or party. Because of ads, polititions
can increase how many people see and know about them. However, polititions could also hire hackers to increase their votes
or decrease another politition's votes.

Weekly Journal Prompt: It is important to protect your personal information when online because hackers can and will use it
for personal gain. By not being dumb and careful of what you say, your information can be secured. I don't share personal
things online except in messages in group chats. Don't share your personal information with them.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Christmas is a holiday where we learn the gift of giving, family time, and gifts. We can relate to
christmas with technology because of online shopping. Data analysis can analyze what gifts are popular and give advice on
what gifts they might like.

As technology advances, it might use more data from your history to find out the perfect gift for you. And not just for
holidays, but for other events too. You can have all the news you would want at the tip of your fingers.

Weekly Journal Prompt: Technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food because the AI and robots are
in charge of maintaining our food. Because of vertical farming, more food is available faster for the holidays. If there was
a outage of power, our fridges would stop working, and the food would rot.
# December 2, 2024
Weekly Journal Prompt: AI that can learn from humans will be a huge leap towards the future.
Follow up Questions: I worry that AI will continue to take over jobs. AI could help me with my code. We should be careful as
not to give AI too much control. However, Avancing AI is much necessary to continue towards the future.
